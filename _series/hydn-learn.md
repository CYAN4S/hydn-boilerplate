Example case of category feature.

Just like category pages, independent pages for a single series are created only by creating MD(or HTML) files in this(`/_series`) folder.

`short_name` property should exist in YAML header. (Just like above.)

You can make `title` property too. If you don't define `title`, value of `short_name` will replace it.
